# SpeechyT: Open-Source Speech-to-Text for Linux

## Short Version for Agency Blog/Website

We're excited to announce **SpeechyT**, our first open-source contribution to the Linux community — a fast, private, and free speech-to-text tool built for developers and power users.

### The Problem

Linux has always lacked quality speech-to-text solutions. Cloud services require API keys and monthly fees. Desktop apps are Mac/Windows exclusive. Developers and content creators on Linux have been stuck with slow, clunky alternatives.

### The Solution

**SpeechyT** leverages OpenAI's faster-whisper engine to deliver:
- **1-2 second transcriptions** (2-4x faster than standard Whisper)
- **100% offline operation** (complete privacy, no cloud dependencies)
- **Custom dictionary support** (auto-correct technical terms)
- **Transcription history** (never lose your work)
- **Simple mouse button trigger** (no complex UI)

### Why We Built It

At [Your Agency Name], we believe in giving back to the open-source community that powers our work. Linux is our primary development platform, and we wanted a dictation tool that matched our workflow — fast, private, and reliable.

### Technical Highlights

- Built with faster-whisper (C++ optimized Whisper implementation)
- Pure Bash implementation (~500 lines)
- MIT licensed (truly free and open)
- Easy 5-minute installation
- Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides

### Get Started

SpeechyT is available now on GitHub:
