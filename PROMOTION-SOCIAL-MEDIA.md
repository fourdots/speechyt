🧵 Just released SpeechyT — a fast, free, offline speech-to-text tool for Linux!

After years of using Mac/Windows-only dictation apps, I built something for the Linux community. Here's what makes it special: 👇

(1/8)

⚡ Lightning fast: 1-2 second transcriptions using faster-whisper (not standard Whisper)

That's 2-4x faster than other open-source solutions. Speed matters when you're dictating frequently.

(2/8)

🔒 100% private: Everything runs locally. Your voice never leaves your computer. No API keys, no cloud services, no tracking.

Because privacy should be the default, not a premium feature.

(3/8)

🎯 Smart dictionary: Add technical terms once, they're capitalized correctly forever.

kubernetes → Kubernetes
postgresql → PostgreSQL
fastapi → FastAPI

Two-layer correction system for maximum accuracy.

(4/8)

📜 Transcription history: Auto-saves your last 20 transcriptions with timestamps.

Never lose your work again. Quick copy with one command.

(5/8)

🖱️ Dead simple UX: Double-tap mouse button → speak → double-tap → text appears.

No complex GUI, no configuration hell. Just works.

(6/8)

🆓 Actually free: MIT licensed, open source, no hidden costs.

Not "free tier with premium features." Not "free for personal use only." Actually free.

🎙️ Excited to announce SpeechyT — a fast, private, open-source speech-to-text solution for Linux!

As developers, we've always envied Mac users with their seamless dictation apps. Cloud services work, but they're slow, expensive, and raise privacy concerns.

So I built SpeechyT: a Linux-native tool that delivers 1-2 second transcriptions, runs 100% offline, and respects your privacy. No API keys, no subscriptions, no compromises.

Key features:
✨ 2-4x faster than standard Whisper implementations
🔒 Complete privacy (everything runs locally)
🎯 Custom dictionary for technical terms
📜 Automatic transcription history
🖱️ Simple mouse button trigger
🆓 MIT licensed and truly free

Whether you're a developer dictating code comments, a writer working on documentation, or anyone who values privacy and speed, SpeechyT might be for you.

Check it out: https://github.com/fourdots/speechyt

This is my first public open-source project, and I'm excited to share it with the community. Feedback and contributions welcome!
